I made it through the wilderness
Somehow I made it through
Didn't know how lost I was until I found you
I was beat, incomplete
I'd been had, I was sad and blue, but you made me feel
Yeah, you made me feel shiny and new

Like a virgin
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
When your heart beats next to mine

Gonna give you all my love, boy
My fear is fading fast
Been saving it all for you, 'cause only love can last
You're so fine and you're mine
Make me strong, yeah you make me bold, oh your love thawed out
Yeah, your love thawed out what was scared and cold

Like a virgin (Hey)
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
With your heartbeat next to mine


Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa, ah
Whoa whoa whoa

You're so fine and you're mine
I'll be yours 'til the end of time 'cause you made me feel
Yeah, you made me feel I've nothing to hide

Like a virgin (Hey)
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
With your heartbeat next to mine

Like a virgin
Ooh-ooh, like a virgin
Feels so good inside
When you hold me, and your heart beats, and you love me
Oh-ooh oh-oh-oh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh baby, yeah
Can't you hear my heart beat for the very first time?

I finally made it through med school
Somehow I made it through
I'm just an intern
I still make a mistake or two
I was last in my class
Barely passed at the institute
Now I'm trying to avoid, yeah I'm trying to avoid
A malpractice suit

Hey, like a surgeon
Cuttin' for the very first time
Like a surgeon
Organ transplants are my line

Better give me all your gauze, nurse
This patient's fading fast
Complications have set in
Don't know how long he'll last
Let me see that I.V
Here we go time to operate
I'll pull his insides out, pull his insides out
And see what he ate

Like a surgeon, hey
Cuttin' for the very first time
Like a surgeon
Here's a waiver for you to sign
Woe, woe, woe

It's a fact, I'm a quack
The disgrace of the A.M.A
Cause my patients die, yeah, my patients die
Before they can pay

Like a surgeon, hey
Cuttin' for the very first time
Like a surgeon
Got your kidneys on my mind

Like a surgeon, ooh like a surgeon
When I reach inside
With my scalpel, and my forceps, and re-tractors
Oh oh, oh oh, woe, oh
Ooh baby, yeah
I can hear your heartbeat
For the very last time
