The horizon problem becomes apparent when researchers examine the uniformity and consistency of cosmic microwave background radiation. CMB radiation is the thermal radiation left over from our universe's formation when it was about 380,000 years old. This radiation occurred shortly after the Big Bang, when visible light could first move freely without obstruction.

The apparent consistency of CMB – which reflects temperature variations at a scale of one part in 100,000 – indicates that the furthest reaches of outer space were once in thermal equilibrium. In other words, the universe's most distant parts were once the same temperature, suggesting that heat was evenly distributed in all directions.

However, these regions are far apart. Considering our universe's age and the speed of light (approximately 186,000 miles per second), it should be physically impossible that these regions could have ever been close enough to interact and equilibrate directly since the inception of the Big Bang. To put it more simply, the horizon problem raises a compelling question of how the universe's distant parts could somehow end up with such similar temperatures and characteristics.
